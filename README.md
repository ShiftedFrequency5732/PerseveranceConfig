# PerseveranceConfig
Just my Neovim `PerseveranceConfig`, highly based on the Neovim IDE from scratch tutorial from chris@machine author, that you can find on the youtube.

However, it is slightly different.

Instead of using `packer`, `lazy.nvim` is used as a package manager.

Instead of deprecated `nvim-lsp-installer`, `mason` is used as the LSP package manager, and so on and so on.

Feel free to use it!
